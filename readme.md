## SimpleStatsPlugin
A simple plugin to help me learn how to write plugins and show some info about your Minecraft server

Basically, I wanted to learn how to write plugins, and I also wanted to see some internal information to the server 
(memory usage, tick times, chunks loaded, etc) so I created this plugin to knock out both of those goals at once.

#### Features
* It'll show you how much memory your Minecraft server is using, and the max amount of memory it can use
* It can also show you the precise server timings, in milliseconds, at a glance
* It can tell you how many chunks are loaded across the server, and how many are loaded in each dimension
* that's basically it, I mean I created it just to help me learn how to write plugins so idk what you were expecting

#### Future Features
* Show live server TPS in the player list
